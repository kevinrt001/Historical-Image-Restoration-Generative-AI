**Project Title: Colorizing Historical B&W Portraits**

**Project Concept:** 

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of colourising black
and white (B&W) portraits, thereby adding vibrancy and realism to historical images that were
originally captured in monochrome. The project plans to leverage machine learning models such
as conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically Pix2Pix, to
achieve image-to-image translation. This approach will enable the transformation of grayscale
images into colourized versions by learning the complex mappings between the monochrome
input and the colour output domains, with the ultimate goal of producing colourized portraits that
are both visually appealing and historically authentic.

**Project Motivation:** 

The motivation behind this project stems from a deep passion for machine learning and the
powerful problem-solving capabilities it offers. As someone who has always been fascinated by
the potential of technology to transform and enrich our understanding of the world, I was drawn
to the idea of using machine learning to bridge the gap between the past and the present.
Moreover, the desire to see life as it was before, to catch a glimpse of how my grandparents and
extended family lived and looked many years ago, fueled this endeavour. The project is not just
an academic exercise but a personal journey to connect with my roots and provide my family
with a unique gift: colourized photographs of their younger selves, bringing out the colours of
their clothes, the backgrounds of their lives, and the shades of their experiences. This
endeavour goes beyond the technical challenge, it's about reimagining history, restoring
vibrancy to the faded memories, and offering a colourful glimpse into a time that exists now only
in black and white snapshots. By merging my love for machine learning with a desire to visually
experience and share my family's past, this project aims to make history come alive, one
colourized portrait at a time.

**Project Applications:** 

The applications of this project extend far beyond the personal and into realms where the past's
visualisation can serve educational, cultural, and emotional purposes. By colourizing historical
black and white portraits, we can enhance the way educational materials depict historical events
and figures, making them more relatable and engaging for students. Museums and cultural
institutions could use this technology to bring exhibitions to life, offering visitors a more
immersive experience by showcasing colourized images of historical significance. Moreover, this project has the potential to aid in documentary filmmaking, providing filmmakers with a tool to present historical content in a more visually appealing manner, thereby enriching the storytelling process. On a personal level, it offers individuals the unique opportunity to connect with their ancestry by seeing their relatives in a new light, adding depth to family histories and memories. Ultimately, the project aims to democratise access to the past, making history not just something
to be read about in textbooks but to be seen and felt, as vividly as the present.

**Project Deliverables:**

The project deliverables are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of deep
learning in colourizing black and white portraits, with a focus on creating tangible, practical
outputs. The primary deliverables include:

- **Deep Learning Model:** We will develop a deep learning model based on conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - Pix2Pix. The model will be
meticulously trained and optimised to perform image-to-image translation from black and
white to colour.

- **LAB and RGB Colour Versions:** For the model, we will produce colourized images in
both LAB and RGB colour spaces. LAB colour space is chosen for its ability to more
closely mimic human vision, particularly in the differentiation of colours, while RGB is
used for its compatibility with digital displays and common image formats. This dual
approach allows us to explore the nuances of colour representation and its impact on the
quality of the colourized images.

- **Visual Comparisons:** We will conduct detailed visual comparisons between the colourized outputs and any available original colour
references or expertly colourized examples. This qualitative analysis will help assess the
models' ability to reproduce realistic skin tones, clothing colours, and background
elements, providing a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and areas for
improvement.
